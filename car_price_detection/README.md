# Car Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict car selling prices using both numerical and categorical features. It includes preprocessing pipelines, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizations.

**Features**
- Handling missing values and categorical encoding
- Numeric scaling with StandardScaler
- Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation: MAE, RMSE, R2 Score
- Visualizations: True vs Predicted, Residual Plot, Feature Importance

**Tech Stack**
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Files Included**
car_price_prediction.ipynb  
car_price_prediction.py  
car data.csv  
README.md

**How to Run**
1. Install dependencies: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib  
2. Open the notebook or run the script  
3. Execute preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization steps

**Result**
The model predicts car prices accurately and shows which features influence prices the most.
