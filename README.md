# OIBSIP

This repository contains three complete machine learning projects: Iris Classification, Spam Detection, and Car Price Prediction. Each project includes preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

**Projects Included**
1. **Iris Flower Classification**
   - Classifies Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
   - Uses four numeric features
   - Includes preprocessing, scaling, model comparison, and PCA visualization
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest

2. **Email Spam Detection**
   - Classifies emails as spam or ham
   - Includes text cleaning, TF-IDF vectorization, model training
   - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVC
   - Includes confusion matrix, ROC curve, and length distribution plots

3. **Car Price Prediction**
   - Predicts car selling price based on multiple features
   - Handles categorical + numerical data, preprocessing pipelines
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, GridSearchCV

**Folder Structure**
The repository is organized into three separate project folders:
- iris_classification/
- spam_detection/
- car_price_prediction/

Each folder contains:
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Dataset (.csv)
- Project-specific README.md

**Tech Stack**
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

**How to Use**
1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Navigate into any project folder  
3. Run the script or open the notebook  
4. Execute all steps to train and evaluate the model  

**Goal of This Repository**
This collection helps beginners understand end-to-end machine learning workflows, including:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results

Each project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates practical ML implementations.
