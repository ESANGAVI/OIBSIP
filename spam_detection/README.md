# Email Spam Detection

This project trains a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham. It includes text cleaning, TF-IDF feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.

**Features**
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, removing numbers & special characters)
- TF-IDF vectorization for email text
- Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVC
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Visualizations: ROC Curve, Spam vs Ham message length comparison

**Tech Stack**
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Files Included**
spam_detection.ipynb  
spam_detection.py  
spam.csv  
README.md

**How to Run**
1. Install dependencies: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib  
2. Run the notebook or script  
3. Execute all steps to train, evaluate, and visualize results

**Result**
The model identifies spam emails effectively and provides clear visual performance metrics.
